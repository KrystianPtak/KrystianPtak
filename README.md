# Hello there!  I'm Krystian 👋👩🏾‍💻

### Glad to see you here!   
⭐I'm a high school student who lives in the United States. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future). It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.⭐

🔭 I’m currently working on Typescript course project
